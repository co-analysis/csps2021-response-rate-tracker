<li>The 2021 People Survey ran from 28 September to 3 November.</li>
<li>Final response rates include paper survey respondents, during the
fieldwork period only online responses were shown in this tool.</li>
<li>The acronyms provided in the code column of the table are internal
codes used by the People Survey and may not relate to official acronyms
used by the organisation.</li>
<li>The People Survey is not a source of official statistics on the size
of Civil Service organisations, as such organisational headcounts and
numbers of responses are not provided in this table. Please refer to the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/civil-service-statistics-2021">Civil
Service Statistics</a> published by the Cabinet Office and the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/publicsectorpersonnel/bulletins/publicsectoremployment/previousReleases">Public
Sector Employment statistics</a> published by the Office for National
Statistics for the latest official statistics.</li>
<li>Some organisations invite a larger number of people working for
their organisation than their official civil service headcount to
complete their survey. For example, FCDO ask locally engaged staff
working in overseas missions and MOD ask military staff working in
civilian MOD roles to participate in the survey.</li>
